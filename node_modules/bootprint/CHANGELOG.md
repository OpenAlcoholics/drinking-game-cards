# Version 2.0.1 (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 19:26:05 GMT)

* [663e3c2](https://github.com/bootprint/bootprint/commit/663e3c2) Add "engine"-property (node >=6) to package.json... - Nils Knappmeier

# Version 2.0.0 (Sun, 23 Apr 2017 14:47:57 GMT)

## Breaking changes

* **customize-engine-uglify was removed from default-engines**: [bootprint-openapi#86](https://github.com/bootprint/bootprint-openapi/issues/86) 
  revealed that the JavaScript-files generated and included by bootprint@1.0.x are basically useless.
  They were added in order to add interactive-features, but that has never been done.
  In version 2.x, the generation of JavaScript-files is removed again. It might be added in `bootprint-openapi`
  or another module, when there are feature that they are needed for.

* **Change in the JavaScript-API**: The JavaScript-API of bootprint@0.x was developed in order to be able to customize 
  input and configuration values. This functionality was then extracted into the Customize project. In bootprint@1.x
  the API was kept compatible. The new API is now totally different and designed for the needs of the command-line interface.
  As a result, if only allows one module and one configuration file.
  The use of the JavaScript-API is deprecated. If you need and this API, you can use the packages `customize`, `customize-engine-handlebars`
  and `customize-engine-less` directly. The use can (i.e. will be) found in the documentation of this package.

* **Drop support for older versions of NodeJS**: From version 2.0 on, only NodeJS 6.x and NodeJS 7.x will be supported. This 
  allows us to use new language-features like arrow functions and Promises (without using 3rd-party Promise libraries).

* Issue #7: ReferenceError: httpGet is not defined
